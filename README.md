Modeling tennis matches using Monte Carlo simulations incorporating dynamic parameters

This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of a Monte Carlo simulation that integrates dynamic tennis parameters in forecasting the outcome of a specific match. 

To predict the outcome of a tennis match, a conventional Monte Carlo simulation based on the identical and independent point distribution 
assumption requires only two parameters: the probabilities of both players winning a point on their own serve. 

A more sophisticated method proposed in this paper considers how fatigue affects a player's performance.
It analyses and implements the change in the probability of winning a service point after "breaking" an opponent's service game. 
Calculating the relevant statistics required for player profiling was a critical step in this study. 
Following that, both previously mentioned variations of the Monte Carlo simulation were implemented to compare their performance. 

Finally, the method was tested on real-world tennis data.
